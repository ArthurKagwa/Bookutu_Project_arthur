# âœ… Dynamic Templates Setup Complete

## Issue Fixed
The server was crashing with `ProgrammingError: relation "bookutu_systemsettings" does not exist` because the database tables for the new SystemSettings model hadn't been created yet.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Exception Handling
- **Context Processor**: Added try/catch to provide fallback values when database tables don't exist
- **SystemSettings Model**: Added exception handling in `get_settings()` method
- **Template Tags**: Already had fallback values built-in

### 2. Created Database Migration
- Created `bookutu/migrations/0001_initial.py` with SystemSettings and Announcement models
- Added migration to setup script

### 3. Setup Command
- Created `setup_dynamic_templates` management command
- Automatically runs migrations and initializes system settings
- **Successfully executed** âœ…

## Current Status

### âœ… **System is Working**
```
ðŸ§ª Testing Dynamic Templates System
==================================================
âœ… SystemSettings model working
   Platform Name: Bookutu
   Platform Tagline: Bus Booking Platform
   Primary Color: #059669
   Secondary Color: #10b981
âœ… Template tags working
   platform_name tag: Bookutu
   platform_tagline tag: Bus Booking Platform
   primary_color tag: #059669

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Dynamic templates are working correctly.
```

### âœ… **Database Tables Created**
- `bookutu_systemsettings` - Platform configuration
- `bookutu_announcement` - System announcements

### âœ… **Templates are Dynamic**
All templates now use:
- `{% platform_name %}` instead of hardcoded "Bookutu"
- `{% primary_color %}` for dynamic branding colors
- `{% welcome_message %}` for customizable messages
- Exception handling ensures graceful fallbacks

## How to Use

### 1. **Start the Server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The server will now start without errors and display dynamic content.

### 2. **Customize Settings**
- Access Django Admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
- Go to "System Settings" to customize:
  - Platform name and tagline
  - Brand colors
  - Welcome messages
  - Contact information
  - Feature toggles

### 3. **Create Announcements**
- In Django Admin, go to "Announcements"
- Create targeted messages for different user types
- Set start/end dates for scheduling

### 4. **Templates Automatically Update**
- All templates will immediately reflect your changes
- No code deployment needed for branding updates
- Settings are cached for performance

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `bookutu/migrations/0001_initial.py`
- `bookutu/management/commands/setup_dynamic_templates.py`
- `test_dynamic_templates.py`

### Modified Files
